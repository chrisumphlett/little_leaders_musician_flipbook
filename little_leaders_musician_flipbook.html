### Project description

An #rstats exploration of last.fm data on the 11 musical artists feature in the books *Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History* and *Little Dreamers: Visionary Women Around the World*, both by Vashti Harrison. These are amongst my 7 year-old daughter's favorite books; she enjoys learning about these women as well as looking at the beautiful illustrations.

Her favorite illustration was that of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a gospel singer who helped laid the foundations for rock and roll in the 1930s and 1940s. This led us to systematically learn about all of the musicians. Together we went through the books and found all musicians, obtained data from last.fm and listened to some of their music. We created a Spotify playlist with the most popular song of each artist that you can listen to: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5G774SxFRCAMYgXcGHOLPb

Each song is embedded in a spotify player on each artist's slide as well. In addition you can read the short version of the artist's biography and learn about their songs' popularity with last.fm users and see similar artists.

Kyria picked the colors of the bars on the charts, font and slide background colors, and helped design the layout of the artist slides.

### Technical stuff
  
  This project was also an excuse for me to learn the R package `xaringan`. The flipbook is made with `xaringan` within R Studio using an R Markdown document. [Much more information on that available here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

I have a [GitHub repo]() where you can see the full code used to create the flipbook.

I was inspired by this [ggplot flipbook made by Gina Reynolds](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1). This is a great introduction to creating graphics in R with the `ggplot` package.
                                                               
Some other packages I wanted to work were utilized: `lastfmr` to utilize the Last.Fm API and `ggimage` to create the scatterplot with pictures as the dot type.
